	Abstract = {An exploratory numerical study of the control of transitional and turbulent separated flows by means of dielectric-barrier-discharge (DBD) actuators is presented.  The flow fields are simulated employing a high-fidelity Navier-Stokes solver augmented with a phenomenological model representing the plasma-induced body forces imparted by the actuator on the fluid.  Several applications are considered, including interaction of an actuator with a laminar boundary layer, suppression of wing stall, control of boundary layer transition on a plate, control of laminar separation over a ramp, and turbulent separation over a wall-mounted hump.},
