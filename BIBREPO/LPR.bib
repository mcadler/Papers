  abstract = {Hi Robert,
	
	 The 2006 Wilcox k-w model in GASP is implemented as it
	
	 is presented in Wilcox's book (Turbulence Modeling for CFD,
	
	 Third Edition, section 4.3.1). For the 2006 model, the
	
	 stress-limiter is built into the model. So to answer your
	
	 original question, yes, the 2006 Wilcox k-w model has the
	
	 stress-limiter and the other Wilcox k-w models (88 and 98)
	
	 limit the ratio of the production to dissipation for the
	
	 TKE equation to 10 (as I stated in a previous e-mail).
	
	 I'll work on getting the technical manual updated since it
	
	 does not mention the 2006 model or the limit on the source
	
	 term ratio.}
