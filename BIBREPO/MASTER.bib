        cooperative program includes eight different flight test experiments
        designed to target specific challenges of hypersonic flight. The
        second of the eight planned flight experiments is a hydrocarbon-fueled
        scramjet flight test intended to demonstrate dual-mode to scramjet-mode
        operation and verify the scramjet performance prediction and design

        establish a fuel distribution schedule to ensure a successful mode

        the phase I test plans include testing over the Mach 6 to 8 flight
        simulation range, only Mach 6 testing will be reported in this paper.
        Experimental results presented here include flowpath surface pressure,
        temperature, and heat flux distributions that demonstrate the operation
        of the flowpath over a small range of test conditions around the
        nominal Mach 6 simulation, as well as a range of fuel equivalence
        ratios and fuel injection distributions. Both ethylene and a mixture
        of ethylene and methane (planned for flight) were tested. Maximum
        back pressure and flameholding limits, as well as a baseline fuel
        schedule, that covers the Mach 5.84 – 6.5 test space have been identified.},

        Mach 8 ground test results are presented in this report, including
        flowpath surface pressure

        distributions that demonstrate the operation of the flowpath in scramjet-mode
        over a small

        range of test conditions around the nominal Mach 8 simulation, as
        well as over a range of

        fuel equivalence ratios. Flowpath analysis using ground test data
        is presented elsewhere;

        however, limited comparisons with analytical predictions suggest that
        both scramjet-mode

        operation and the combustion performance objective are achieved at
        Mach 8 conditions.},
